// Generated from the Ansight repository task v1 contract.

/**
 * # Purpose and usage
 *
 * This file defines the resident host's authoring contract; it is not an executable
 * task. Executable task modules are owned by each app repository and live under
 * that repository's `ansight/tasks` directory. The host discovers them only from
 * the repository registered for the selected App ID.
 *
 * A repository task is an explicitly invoked, app-specific automation for a
 * known repeatable workflow. Use a task when a user or agent should run a named
 * cycle on demand—for example navigating to a feature, performing gestures,
 * querying custom app state, and validating the result.
 *
 * Tasks replace repeated model-driven UI decisions with deterministic local
 * code. An agent or parent task first discovers a focused task, optionally
 * inspects its input and schemas, then invokes its exact ID against the selected
 * live Ansight session. Standard host, task-composition, and app APIs are
 * available without descriptor boilerplate.
 *
 * A task's named `expect` assertions are its authoritative success evidence. A
 * normal return without an assertion is inconclusive. Tasks do not subscribe to
 * events or run in the background; use a repository trigger for that purpose.
 *
